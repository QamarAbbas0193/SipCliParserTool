Write a Python CLI program that reads in a .txt file, which contains a SIP request following the format of RFC3261 (see the attached example file 'sip_request.txt').
Example: 'python -m parse_request.py <option> <path-to-sip-file>/<file-name>.txt'
The CLI program shall support the following command line options:
a) '-p --print': The .txt file is parsed and the following message is printed:
       """
       The given SIP message is a request with:
       request-uri: <request-uri>
       method: <method>
       headers:
          <header-1>: <header-1-content>
          <header-1>: <header-1-content>
          <...>: <...>
       and body:
          <raw-body>
       """

b) '-e --exists <header-name>': The .txt file is parsed and the program prints whether the given header exists and what its contents are
    Note: Headers in SIP are case-insensitive and so must be <header-name>

c) '-v --validate': The .txt file is parsed and the request should be checked for compliance with the RFC3261 Sections 8.1.1, 8.1.1.1, 
   8.1.1.2 and 8.1.1.3. In case no issues are found, such as with the attached example file 'sip_request.txt', the following 
   message should be printed:
      """
      The request has been verified and no issues were found. 
      """
   If an issue is found, such as the Call-ID missing in violation of RFC3261 Section 8.1.1 in the attached example file
   'sip_request_without_call_id.txt', an error similar to the one shown below should be printed:
      """
      The verification of the request failed due to the following reason(s):
      Error: The "Call ID" header is missing, as required by "RFC3261 Section 8.1.1"  
      """
   Once your program is ready, please pass the test inputs 'test_input_1.txt', 'test_input_2.txt', 'test_input_3.txt' and share the results for these with us along with your program.
